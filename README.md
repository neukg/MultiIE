## Introduction
Code for "A Simple but Effective System for Multi-format Information Extraction"(NLPCC 2021) and [LIC-2021](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/65?isFromLuge=true&lang=zh_CN)（2021语言与智能技术竞赛：多形态信息抽取任务）.

Our approach is evaluated with '**DuIE2.0**', '**DuEE1.0**' and '**DuEE-fin**' and ranks **No.4**. The dataset can be found in '[LUGE](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/46/?isFromLUGE=TRUE)'.

#### DuIE2.0

We ensemble three public project *TPLinker*[1] (project is [here](https://github.com/131250208/TPlinker-joint-extraction)), *SPN*[2] (project is [here](https://github.com/DianboWork/SPN4RE)), *CasRel*[3] (project is [here](https://github.com/weizhepei/CasRel)). So we don't provide our code.

Thanks for their public project.

#### DuEE1.0

The detail is found in EE.

#### DuEE-fin

The detail is found in EE-fin.
